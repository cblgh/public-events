# Dat events website

A simple static teaser page for Dat events. Built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Published on [events.dat.foundation](https://events.dat.foundation) with Netlfiy.

To develop locally:
```bash
cd website
npm run dev
```

To build the static export:
```
npm run build
```

The static export then is in `website/_site`.
