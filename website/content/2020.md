## Dat Conference 2020

Virtual peer to peer event about local-first tech and meetup space for everyone interested in the decentralized web.

- _Date:_ **July 30/31, 2020**
- _Location:_ **Worldwide (Online)**

Dat is a protocol for peer to peer tools and a community of projects. At the first virtual Dat conference, we want to connect people involved in the community and its surroundings. We’ll provide some infrastructure, a website and a schedule and we’ll try to assist with technical needs for special sessions.

Filling this space will be up to all of you! If you wanna do intros and presentations there’ll be a dedicated channel for prerecorded videos. For the actual conference, we’re looking for all kinds of ideas how to foster collaboration, inclusiveness and knowledge sharing, experimentation and discussion. This could be workshops, technical deep dive discussions, VR meetups, collaborative livecoding - be creative!

Let’s share our approaches and talk about the present and future of local-first tech. Please submit your ideas in [as issues in our issue tracker](https://github.com/datproject/public-events/issues/new?assignees=&labels=proposal&template=proposal.md&title=), which will be accepted until **June 1st, 2020** _(23:59 PST)_. If you have any questions or want to discuss your ideas in advance, please just come by [at a comm-comm meeting](https://github.com/datproject/comm-comm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ameeting) or come to our [public chat channel](https://dat.foundation/community/chat/).
